## 📂 Datasets Used for Training

The models in this project were trained using the following publicly available datasets from Kaggle:

- 🔢 **Digit Sign Language (0–9)**:  
  [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)

- 🇮🇳 **Indian Sign Language (A–Z)**:  
  [Indian Sign Language ISL](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathumarikeri/indian-sign-language-isl)

- 🇺🇸 **American Sign Language Digits (0–9)**:  
  [ASL Digit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rayeed045/american-sign-language-digit-dataset)

These datasets were preprocessed and used to train the models included in this app.
